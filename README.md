Based Black Music Player
========================

Minimal, responsive, aesthetically pleasing frontend for MPD. Written in Jai, inspired by `ncmpcpp`.

Configuration
-------------

If you have `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` defined, then save your config to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bbmp/bbmprc`.
Otherwise, save it to`$HOME/.bbmprc`.

Example config:

```
mpd_host              = localhost
mpd_port              = 6600
max_log_size          = 1000
log_level             = normal
mpd_library_directory = ~/media/music/library
album_cover_directory = ~/.cache/bbmp/covers
```

Description of these values:

-   `mpd_host`: The URI of the MPD host to connect to. Defaults to `localhost`.
-   `mpd_port`: The port of the MPD host to connect to. Defaults to `6600`.
-   `max_log_size`: This is the maximum number of values to store in the debug log. Defaults to `1000`, which is plenty
    for most situations.
-   `log_level`: The verbosity level of the logs to display. This can be `normal`, `verbose`, or `very_verbose`.
    Defaults to `normal`.
-   `mpd_library_directory`: The path to your MPD directory. This must be specified for `bbmp` to locate your album
    cover files. Should be set to the same folder that MPD loads your library from. Does not have a default value.
-   `album_cover_directory`: The directory to save generated album covers to (see the next section for more on this).
    The default is `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/bbmp/covers` if the `XDG_CACHE_HOME` environment variale is set, otherwise the
    default is `$HOME/.cache/bbmp/covers`.

**Note** that, at the moment, MPD must be running *before* starting `bbmp`. Additionally, neither the configuration nor
the music library will hot-reload in `bbmp` if they change -- you have to restart `bbmp` to pull in updates.

Album Cover Generation
----------------------

The `album_cover_directory` is the folder you want `bbmp` to save the generated album covers to. Right now, you must
create this directory manually, it will not be created for you.

For each album cover file in your library named `cover.jpg` or `cover.png`, two bitmap files will be generated and
saved to the `album_cover_directory`: an 800-pixel-width version of the cover, and a 200-pixel-width version. So, the
higher-resolution your original files are, the better these will look.

The 200 px covers are used as thumbnails in the Library Album Art view:

![Library Album Art View](./screenshots/library_album_art.png)

And the 800 px covers are used when viewing a specific album:

![Album View](./screenshots/album.png)

These covers will be generated whenever you start `bbmp` for all albums that don't already have cached covers.

**Note**: A current limitation of `bbmp` is that updating the cached album covers is not very straightforward --
e.g. if you update an album's cover file in your library, any existing covers generated by `bbmp` don't automatically
update. For now, the easiest workaround is to remove all of the generated cover files in your `album_cover_directory`
and restart `bbmp` so that the covers are recreated. This will be made easier in the future.

Keybindings
-----------

The entire program is navigable with keybindings only. There is currently no mouse support, but that may change in the
future. If you're familiar with `ncmpcpp`, then you'll already know many of the basics.

There are a few global keybindings, then each view has its own keybindings.

### Global

### Queue View

-   `j`: Move the cursor down
-   `k`: Move the cursor up
-   `J`: Shift the selected song up in the queue
-   `K`: Shift the selected song down in the queue

-   `g`: Move the cursor to the top of the current column
-   `G`: Move the cursor to the bottom of the current column
-   `o`: Move the cursor to the currently playing song
-   `Space`: Add the selected song to the queue
-   `Enter`: Add the selected song to the queue and play it
-   `/`: Start a search
    -   `Enter`/`Escape`: Submit the search
-   `n`: Move the cursor to the next search result in the current column
-   `N`: Move the cursor to the previous search result in the current column

### Library Album Art View

#### Library Subview

-   `j`: Move the cursor down
-   `k`: Move the cursor up
-   `j`: Move the cursor left
-   `l`: Move the cursor right
-   `Ctrl-d`: Move the cursor one page down
-   `Ctrl-u`: Move the cursor one page up

-   `/`: Start a search
    -   `Enter`/`Escape`: Submit the search

#### Album Subview

-   `i`: Go back to the Library Subview

### Config Viewer

No keybindings for now. Will eventually be a configuration editor.

### Debug Logs

By default, the log viewer will scroll down as entries are logged so that the most recent are always shown. You can hit
`F` to start a cursor that allows you to navigate the logs with the following keybindings:

-   `j`: Move the cursor down
-   `k`: Move the cursor up
-   `Ctrl-d`: Move the cursor half a page down
-   `Ctrl-u`: Move the cursor half a page up
-   `g`: Move the cursor to the top of the page
-   `G`: Move the cursor to the bottom of the page

This is in lieu of better user notifications + error output.
