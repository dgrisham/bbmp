- [ ] add track length to song list
- [ ] '/' search
- [ ] 'y' for setting single-mode
- [ ] consider what to do with strings that cut off (trailing '...'?)
- [ ] show a simple 'now playing' with song metadata + current / total time
- [ ] All That Remains - Overcome missing?
- [ ] consider this in ncmpcpp's status.cpp:
    ```
	// Set TCP_NODELAY on the tcp socket as we are using write-write-read pattern
	// a lot (noidle - write, command - write, then read the result of command),
	// which kills the performance.
	int flag = 1;
	setsockopt(Mpd.GetFD(), IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_NODELAY, &flag, sizeof(flag));
    ```

- [x] artist (and general, probably) sorting puts lowercase after uppercase
- [x] 'o' to to go to currently playing track
- [x] sort albums by date
- [x] preload all of the songs/albums
- [x] limit text length
- [x] consistency with cursor scroll offset between top and bottom of long list (or just scrolloffset logic in general)
