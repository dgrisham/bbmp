- [ ] ask about proper way of getting font width (font.em_width vs. my font.w_width hack)
    -   expected width may still sometimes be wrong
- [ ] 'y' for setting single-mode

'memory leak' measurements

loading texture from file:   RES:  93 MB (VIRT: 161 MB)
loading texture from bitmap: RES: 289 MB (VIRT: 297 MB)
loading texture from memory: RES: 477 MB (VIRT: 817 MB)

load texture from file on main thread
    -   before loading textures: 94 MB
    -   after loading textures: 355 MB, 424 MB
load bitmap on worker -> load texture from bitmap, free bitmap
    -   before loading textures: RES: 289 MB (VIRT: 497 MB)
    -   after loading textures:  RES: 330 MB (VIRT: 727 MB)
load bitmap on worker -> load texture from file, free bitmap
    -   before loading textures: RES: 293 MB (VIRT: 497 MB)
    -   after loading textures:  RES: 352 MB (VIRT: 749 MB)
load bitmap on worker -> free bitmap
    -   before freeing bitmaps: RES: 292 MB (VIRT: 497 MB)
    -   after freeing bitmaps:  RES: 108 MB (VIRT: 505 MB)

### from another set of runs

no work
 0 threads -- RES: 123 MB (VIRT: 169 MB)
 5 threads -- RES: 122 MB (VIRT: 192 MB)

resizing 200x:
 2 threads -- RES: 255 MB (VIRT: 382 MB)
 5 threads -- RES: 379 MB (VIRT: 590 MB)
 7 threads -- RES: 490 MB (VIRT: 718 MB)
10 threads -- RES: 676 MB (VIRT: 910 MB)

without resizing (just loading):
 5 threads -- RES: 318 MB (VIRT: 590 MB)

resizing 600x:
 5 threads -- RES: 369 MB (VIRT: 580 MB)

song was added to queue, then removed from library, then upon reopening bbmp:
```
[queue] Queue song URI not found in library: 'disturbed/2008_04-indestructible/1_06-haunted.mp3'
[album_art_thread] This machine reports 6 CPUs for 1798 jobs; starting 5 threads.
/home/grish/src/jai/bbmp/queue.jai:544,5: Assertion failed: Queue song position was 5, should be less than 5

Stack trace:

```

it's probably that the queue length returned by mpd isn't reliable in these cases, as it seems to only count valid songs.
